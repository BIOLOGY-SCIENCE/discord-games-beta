## Why is discord-games-beta deprecated ?
- I started this project as a testing package with npm, I did not have any plans making this a bigger project.
- When I started this project, there was this only way, using discord bots to start the activities in your voice channels. But now, Discord has enabled activities to most of the servers so there is no point on using a bot to start play these activities any more.

# Does that mean I can't use this package any more ?
**Absolutely not.**  
You can use this package whenever you like, and however you like. But the only thing is that, this package will no longer receive any updates / changes.

# What now ?
You can still use this package, but if discord adds any new activities, you wouldn't be able to play them with this package. To play them you can use any of the [alternative packages](#alternative-packages-to-discord-games-beta).

# Alternative packages to discord-games-beta
