# Discord Games BETA
### **NOTE**:
This is my first npm package, used for testing with my friends. Feel free to continue reading if you want to use it for yourself.

<br>

# What is this ?
This is a package used to enable an game event inside a **Discord Voice Channel**, like **YouTube Watch Togther**, **Chess**, **Word Tile**, and much more.

# How does this work ?
This works by creating an invite to a voice channel of your will in such a way that is makes game playable in that specific voice channel.

# Installation
```
npm i discord-games-beta
```

# Usage

- Constructor:
```js
const DiscordGame = require('discord-games-beta');

const game = new DiscordGame(params);
```
- Params:
```js
/*
const game = new DiscordGame(YourDiscordClient, NameOfTheGame, MaximumDuration)
*/

const game = new DiscordGame(client, 'chess', 3600);

// "client" is the Discord Client which you are using in your code
// "chess" is the name of the game which you wanted to play
// "3600" is the Maximum Duration of the game event in seconds (3600 is 1 Hour in Seconds)
```
### NOTE: The Maximum Duration can only be more than 0

<br>

- Function: 
```js
game.play(vc).then(result => console.log(result));

// "vc" is a Discord Voice channel which you want to play the game in.
```
- Result:
```js
{
    "code" : new String // Code of the invite link
    "inviteLink" : new String // The invite link itself
    "createdAt" : new Date() // The time when the invite was created
    "validTill" : new Date() // The time at which the invite gets expired

    "guild" :
    {
        "id" : new Number // ID of the server in which the invite has been made
        "name" : new String // Name of the server in which the invite has been made
    },

    "channel" :
    {
        "id" : new Number // ID of the channel to which the invite has been made
        "name" : new String // Name of the channel to which the invite has been made
    },

    "inviter" : 
    {
        "id" : new Number // ID of the user who made the invite (i.e, The Bot's ID which has been used to do the task)
        "name" : new String // Name of the user who made the invite (i.e, The Bot's Name which has been used to do the task)
    },

    "app" :
    {
        "id" : new Number // ID of the game
        "name" : new String // Name of the game
        "description" : new String // A short description of the game
        "summary" : new String // A summary of the game
        "maxMembers" : new String // Maximum number of members the game allows
    }
}
```


# Example Code (for one game)

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const DiscordGame = require('discord-games-beta');

const client = new Discord.Client();
const YouTube = new DiscordGame(client, 'youtube', 3600);

client.on('message', (message) => // replace ('message', with ('messageCreate', if you are on discord.js v13
{
    if (message.content === 'play')
    {    
        const VoiceChannel = message.member.voice.channel;  // The voice channel in which the event is gonna occur

        YouTube.play(VoiceChannel).then(result => message.channel.send(result.inviteLink));
    }
});

client.login('YourBotTokenHere');
```
![Example Code (for one game)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIOLOGY-SCIENCE/discord-games-beta/main/assets/one%20game.png)

## What should I do if I want to play other games ?
Just replace **name of the game** which is the second parameter of constructor (i.e, `new DiscorGame()`) with any of the available games

To get the list of the **available games** you can do
```js
const DiscordGame = require('discord-games-beta');
const game = new DiscordGame();

console.log(game.gameNames); // This will print all the available games in your console !
```
### Output:
```js
["youtube", "poker", "betrayal", "fishing", "chess", "lettertile", "wordsnack", "awkword", "doodlecrew", "spellcast", "checkers"]
```

# Example code (for more than one games)

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const DiscordGame = require('discord-games-beta');

const client = new Discord.Client();

const YouTube = new DiscordGame(client, 'youtube', 3600);
const Chess = new DiscordGame(client, 'chess', 3600);
const LetterTile = new DiscordGame(client, 'lettertile', 3600);
const WordSnack = new DiscordGame(client, 'wordsnack', 3600);
const DoodleCrew = new DiscordGame(client, 'doodlecrew', 3600);

client.on('message', (message) => // replace ('message', with ('messageCreate', if you are on discord.js v13
{
    if (message.content === 'play')
    {
        const games =
        [
            "ðŸ‡¦ - YouTube Watch Together",
            "ðŸ‡§ - Chess",
            "ðŸ‡¨ - Letter Tile",
            "ðŸ‡© - Word Snack",
            "ðŸ‡ª - Doodle Crew"
        ];

        const ReactionEmbed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
        .setColor('#2F3136')
        .setDescription(`React to the appropriate emoji to start a game !\n\n${games.join('\n')}`);

        message.channel.send(ReactionEmbed).then((msg) => // change 'ReactionEmbed' to '{embeds: [ReactionEmbed]}' if you are on discord.js v13
        {
            msg.react('ðŸ‡¦');
            msg.react('ðŸ‡§');
            msg.react('ðŸ‡¨');
            msg.react('ðŸ‡©');
            msg.react('ðŸ‡ª');

            const filter = (reaction) => reaction; // remove this line if you are on discord.js v13
            const collector = new Discord.ReactionCollector(msg, filter); // remove ", filter" if you are on discord.js v13
    
            collector.on('collect', (reaction) =>
            {
                if (!reaction.users.cache.has(message.author.id)) return;

                collector.stop();

                const VoiceChannel = message.member.voice.channel;  // The voice channel in which the event is gonna occur

                if (reaction.emoji.name === 'ðŸ‡¦') return YouTube.play(VoiceChannel).then(result => message.channel.send(result.inviteLink));

                if (reaction.emoji.name === 'ðŸ‡§') return Chess.play(VoiceChannel).then(result => message.channel.send(result.inviteLink));

                if (reaction.emoji.name === 'ðŸ‡¨') return LetterTile.play(VoiceChannel).then(result => message.channel.send(result.inviteLink));

                if (reaction.emoji.name === 'ðŸ‡©') return WordSnack.play(VoiceChannel).then(result => message.channel.send(result.inviteLink));

                if (reaction.emoji.name === 'ðŸ‡ª') return DoodleCrew.play(VoiceChannel).then(result => message.channel.send(result.inviteLink));
            });
        });
    }
});

> **Pro Tip**: To make the invite link work forever, you can just replace the number `3600` to **`true`**
